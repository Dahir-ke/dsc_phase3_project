    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Government of Tanzania and water-focused NGOs face limited maintenance budgets while managing thousands of water wells across the country. Some wells are fully functional, some require repair, and others have completely failed. The challenge is to identify which wells are at risk of failure so that maintenance and investment resources can be allocated efficiently and proactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a machine learning classification model to predict the operational status of a water well—functional, in need of repair, or non-functional—based on physical characteristics, installation details, and environmental factors.\n"

    "Tanzania has a population of over 61 million people (2022 Census), the majority of whom rely on public and community-managed water points for daily water access. Even small-scale water well failures can affect thousands of people, particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n",
